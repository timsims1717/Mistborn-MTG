# Mistborn-MtG
A custom Magic the Gathering set based on the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson

Currently on hiatus because there just isn't enough distinct artwork to finish the set.

## Themes

A big part of the first book of the Mistborn series is heists. This is reflected in a small focus on Artifacts and the **Ransack** keyword. A second focus of the book is the rebellion of the Skaa (slave class) against the Nobles and the Lord Ruler. This is represented by the **Recruit** keyword and the **Rebel** class. Other themes include Nobles, intrigue, and of course, magic.

The magic for this set is mainly **Allomancy**, and is represented by activated abilities that do not require tapping. In the books, Allomancers can "burn" metals they have ingested, which doesn't require any sort of outward action, and I felt that distinguishing these Allomantic abilities by not requiring the Creature to tap was a clever feature.

## Keywords

* **Recruit** - Return CARDNAME to its owner's hand. Create a 1/1 white human Skaa rebel creature token. Recruit only as a sorcery.
* **Ransack** - Whenever CARDNAME deals combat damage to a player, exile the top X cards of their library. You may cast spells exiled this way.
* **Infiltrate** - Create a colorless Secret artifact token with "2, T, Sacrifice this artifact: Counter target activated ability."
* **Bureaucracy** - You may have CARDNAME enter the battlefield tapped. When you do, [effect].
